## **Criterion E: Evaluation**

_See Appendix D for Summary of Client’s Feedback _


# Extent To Which Success Criteria Is Met: 

The program has met all the success criteria. The client is pleased with the intuitive and secure check-in/out procedure and credits with the simplicity of adding (_refer to Criterion D for showcase of this functionality_) and viewing employees in a list, and how the program handles errors.

The client is most satisfied with the main functionality of calculating worktime, overtime, diligence absences, and basing it on extra wage types. Error-prone and time-consuming calculations that the client does (_refer to Criterion A for more details_) are accurately and efficiently handled by the program, including tracking absences, capping calculations, distinguishing between extra pay types, and distinguishing weekday and weekend quotas. Finally, he is satisfied with the JSON file that can successfully be emailed as he wishes. He would be able to maintain the program as long as the database is running.


# Further Developments: 

A suggestion I have is to improve the UI such as a profile picture feature for employee accounts.

The client’s suggestions for further development is a two-way binding between the program to the company’s **Microsoft Access business database** (_Refer To Appendix B– Summary Of Client Further Consultation_).

His first suggestion is for the program to have the information in the JSON file email to be written into the business database. The actual extra pay amount for each employee is stored in the business database, so having the information in one place will make it easier for the client to determine extra pay. His second suggestion is to allow the business database to import employee information to the local database, so new or leaving employees will only need to be entered once– in the business database.

Both of these suggestions can be achieved with two different complex scripts. The first script should involve converting the JSON information into Microsoft Access fields. It should allow interoperability– relating employees between the local and business database, which can be done through keeping unique usernames in the business database as well. The second script should be able to convert the Microsoft Access employees into the local database’s Employee entities, regularly (monthly) exporting employee information from the business to the local database.
